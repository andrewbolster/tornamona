# About

I spent an hour trying to do the simple thing of getting `sphinx` to talk to the project root level `README.md`, but
this supposedly simple issue is actually a [big pain](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/7000)

Please go and :thumbsup: that issue, cus this is stupidly simple...

Anyway, the actual [README](https://github.com/andrewbolster/tornamona/) is over on the github, so go there
