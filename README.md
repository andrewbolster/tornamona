A series of fixes for Data originating from Northern Ireland

This is very much a work in progress and I'll only really add to it as things annoy me,
but if you have a data set that's messy, and you can use similar workflows as demonstrated
in this repo, please feel free to use this and PR the crap out of it.

I make no claims of liability, credit, or property over any of this, and make no promises
that anything will ever work or be fixed.

## Current Datasets

### NISRA Weekly Deaths Datasets

Source: https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/weekly-deaths

#### What is this data?
* Weekly death registrations in Northern Ireland, from 2009 - 2020
* Also includes tracking of 2020 COVID outbreak

#### What is wrong with the data as presented?
* The Usual Boilerplate (i.e. non numerical footers, non-merged multi row headers, overly complex column headers, inconsistent structure)
* ~~a typo in the 2014 Week Start date ([Which actually inspired me to make this repo in the first place](https://twitter.com/Bolster/status/1254017115817943041))~~ ([This was fixed](https://twitter.com/NISRA/status/1254689659311054848))
* [~~Then the updates went into new files rather than reusing the same URLs, which makes this whole thing more of a pain~~](https://twitter.com/Bolster/status/1256948066319507458) ([This was also fixed](https://twitter.com/NISRA/status/1257366189803802624))

#### How do I use the new one

```python
from tornamona.fixes import nisra

dataset = nisra.WeeklyDeaths().get().clean()
dataset.data.head().to_markdown()
```
